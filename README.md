The aim of this bot to is to be a historic version of [OwlBot](https://wiki.neozones.club/index.php?title=OwlBot), that as of 2020-01-20, no longer works.

To summarise why this bot and code exist is that as [CyberBus](https://wiki.neozones.club/index.php?title=CyberBus) is now the main bot for the [NeoZones' Discord server](https://neozones.club/discord), it has now taken many of the tasks that OwlBot would have preformed, so this is very much a striped-down version of the final source code for OwlBot.

## Main Differences
Before, the prefix for the bot would have been ">" followed by a command, this has now been replaced by the euro sign (€) for two reasons; one is so that when someone, say, uses a command that would have otherwise overlapped with CyberBus (">help", for example), then it would cause confusion as two bots will post two messages - this will not happen as it uses a new symbol. The second reason is that a user will have to go out of their way to type the € symbol, as it does not appear on ASCII keyboards, effectually discouraging usage of the bot.

This can be changed quite easily in a text editor by pressing Ctrl + H, effectively allowing you to change the prefix to <tt>></tt> or anything else that you want it to be.

The bot will not handout roles to users - CyberBus now does this task.
